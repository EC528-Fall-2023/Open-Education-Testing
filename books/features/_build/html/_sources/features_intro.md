Enhanced OPE
=====================================

In Sprint 5, our team decided to shift our focus towards comprehensive documentation and bringing our collective work into a cohesive format. This effort was part of our ongoing commitment to enhancing the Open Education Project (OPE). We recognized the importance of clear and accessible documentation for both our internal team and the broader community.

One of the key repositories we worked on during this sprint was 'Open-Education-Testing' which you can find on [GitHub link](https://github.com/EC528-Fall-2023/Open-Education-Testing/tree/book-documentation). This repository served as a central hub for us to edit and contribute to the project's documentation at this [link](https://ec528-fall-2023.github.io/Open-Education-Testing/features).

To contribute to this repository, team members followed these steps:
1. Create an empty repository and all team members clone the same repository 
2. Utilize Jupyter Lab: Run jupyter lab in the terminal to access a user-friendly GUI for working on Jupyter notebooks in a web browser
3. Edit relevant files in subdirectories
4. After completing changes, execute make build followed by make pub. These commands ensure that your changes are reflected on the OPE website

Running the git commands add, commit, and push can get tedious when a user may want to see these changes instantly. Therefore our team has created the commands 
```shell
make push
```
```shell
make sync
```
to streamline the git commands. You can see the git commands these commands combine at this [link](https://github.com/EC528-Fall-2023/Open-Education-Testing/tree/book-documentation/books/features) in push.sh and synch.sh.

By working together and dedicating ourselves to documentation, we aimed to provide a valuable resource for the OPE community and align with our commitment to open education and accessible knowledge sharing.
