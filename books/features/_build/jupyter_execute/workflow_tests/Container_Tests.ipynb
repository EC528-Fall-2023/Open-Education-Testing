    "## Testing Overview\n",
    "OPE testing is separated into two parts: (1) container testing and (2) environment testing. A GitHub actions workflow builds the container based on the metadata provided in `base/config.yml`, which includes packages, base image configuration, and image registry information (i.e. where the final container will be published). After building the container image, the workflow runs a series of tests in parallel using [github runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners). If the image pass all of these tests, then a runner publishes it to the image registry (e.g. [quay.io](https://quay.io/)). See the architecture diagram below for a visual run-through of the steps listed above."
