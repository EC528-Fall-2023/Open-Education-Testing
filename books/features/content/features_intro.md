Enhanced OPE
=====================================

In Sprint 5, our team decided to shift our focus towards comprehensive documentation and bringing our collective work into a cohesive format. This effort was part of our ongoing commitment to enhancing the Open Education Project (OPE). We recognized the importance of clear and accessible documentation for both our internal team and the broader community.

One of the key repositories we worked on during this sprint was 'enhanced-ope,' which you can find on [GitHub link](https://github.com/rkulskis/enhanced-ope). This repository served as a central hub for us to edit and contribute to the project's documentation.

To contribute to this repository, team members followed these steps:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/rkulskis/enhanced-ope
2. Utilize Jupyter Lab: Run jupyter lab in the terminal to access a user-friendly GUI for working on Jupyter notebooks in a web browser
3. Edit relevant files in subdirectories
4. After completing changes, execute make build followed by make pub. These commands ensure that your changes are reflected on the OPE website

By working together and dedicating ourselves to documentation, we aimed to provide a valuable resource for the OPE community and align with our commitment to open education and accessible knowledge sharing.
