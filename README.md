# Enhanced OPE
In Sprint 5, our team decided to shift our focus towards comprehensive documentation and bringing our collective work into a cohesive format. This effort was part of our ongoing commitment to enhancing the Open Education Project (OPE). We recognized the importance of clear and accessible documentation for both our internal team and the broader community.

One of the key repositories we worked on during this sprint was ‘Open-Education-Testing’ which you can find on https://github.com/EC528-Fall-2023/Open-Education-Testing/tree/book-documentation. This repository served as a central hub for us to edit and contribute to the project’s documentation: https://ec528-fall-2023.github.io/Open-Education-Testing/features_intro.html#

By working together and dedicating ourselves to documentation, we aimed to provide a valuable resource for the OPE community and align with our commitment to open education and accessible knowledge sharing.
