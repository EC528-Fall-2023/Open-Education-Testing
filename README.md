# Enhanced OPE
In Sprint 5, our team decided to shift our focus towards comprehensive documentation and bringing our collective work into a cohesive format. This effort was part of our ongoing commitment to enhancing the Open Education Project (OPE). We recognized the importance of clear and accessible documentation for both our internal team and the broader community.

One of the key branches we worked on during our progress was this book-documentation branch. This repository served as a central hub for us to edit and contribute to the projectâ€™s documentation: https://ec528-fall-2023.github.io/Open-Education-Testing/features_intro.html#

By working together and dedicating ourselves to documentation, we aimed to provide a valuable resource for the OPE community and align with our commitment to open education and accessible knowledge sharing.
