# Enhanced OPE
OPE project documentation written by Ross Mikulskis. Contributions include Jonathan Mikalov's checksum test page and Riya Deokar's introduction page. This documention covers the following topics:

**Testing**: 
- container testing
- environmental testing

**Features**:
- Jupytexmagic (a Jupyter *magic plugin* for rendering LaTeX using `pdflatex` and `svg` conversion to achieve native rendering capabilities). There is nothing else out there like this plugin. The best is Mathjax or Katex which require a lot of customization and don't have all the capabilities of the standard compiler, `pdflatex`.
- outsourcing Gradescope autograding to OPE containers to on a working kernel to cicrumvent kernel incompatibilities between test code and the gradescope kernel
