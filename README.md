**Team Members**: Yuxi Ge, Jonathan Mikalov, Riya Deokar, Ross Mikulskis, Yiqin Zhang

**Mentor**: Isaiah Stapleton

## 1.   Vision and Goals Of The Project:

Our project's vision is to create an innovative and immersive educational environment where the integration of Jupyter notebooks and Linux terminal interactions transcends traditional learning boundaries. We aim to cultivate a dynamic ecosystem where teachers and students can utilize technology to enhance the educational experience. Some of our visions and improvements consist of: 

Integration of Comprehensive Tests: We recognize the importance of the Master_Container_Test.yml, which consolidates various image, build, gdb, and UI tests into one. To improve this, we will continually update and expand the test suite to cover a broader range of scenarios and edge cases. This will ensure comprehensive validation of the OPE repository base container image.

Recognizing  limitations of outdated testing methods: We are committed to a modernization effort centered around automation. By embracing automated testing, continuous integration and deployment, and scalable frameworks, we aim to improve reliability, efficiency, and adaptability in our testing approach. This shift ensures that as the Open Education (OPE) project evolves, testing practices evolve with it, delivering a more robust and future-ready educational platform.

Continuous Monitoring: We will implement continuous monitoring of our container images to identify any discrepancies, vulnerabilities, or performance issues. This proactive approach will help us maintain the reliability and security of the OPE environment.

Custom Test Development: As part of our commitment to improving the OPE project, we will develop new custom tests tailored to the specific requirements and unique features of our containerized educational materials. These tests will be designed to address our project's needs. 

Training and Skill Development: We recognize the importance of equipping our team members with the skills and knowledge required to excel in testing and automation. We will invest in training, building, and skill development to enhance our team's capabilities.

## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:

Open Education Testing offers a comprehensive Testing Integration suite designed to cover a broad range of scenarios and edge cases. This approach ensures the thorough validation of the base container image in the OPE repository. Embrace technological progress by utilizing automation, efficient continuous integration, deployment, and scalable frameworks. 

Users of this platform may include but are not limited to:

* Educators: These professionals in Computer Science or Engineering require specialized features within the OPE containers, like UID fixes, to cater to the unique requirements of their teaching modules.
* Content Creators: Individuals keen on publishing open-source textbooks online. They focus on tailoring and enhancing educational content to fit seamlessly with the specific needs of containerized environments.
* Developers: Those aspiring to craft robust containers tailored to support the OPE environment efficiently.

## 4. Solution Concept

![](images/diagram.png)


Throughout the duration of this project, we will be contributing directly to open education tests. These tests directly involve the functionality of jupyter notebooks and other supported platforms. They do not involve server-side support, such as containerized support and remote access.

1. **Quay.io
- In order to deal with maintaingin a reliable and accessible educational platform while maintaining a strong infrastructure for development and testing, we use Quay.io.
- Quay.io plays a vital role in our container management strategy. We utilize Quay.io to securely host and distribute our container images, including the OPE repository base container image.
- This platform enables version control, streamlined collaboration, efficient repository management, and improved accessibility for educators and students. Our Quay.io is in the process of being associated with the correct user and container, ensuring clarity and ease of use for all project collaborators.

2. **Address Space Layout Randomization
- We intend to prioritize cybersecurity through the strategic use of Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).
- We will assess ASLR's capability to mitigate memory-based vulnerabilities by introducing controlled vulnerabilities and evaluating their resistance to exploitation.
- We will confirm the randomness of memory addresses, ensuring predictability is minimized.
- By integrating ASLR testing, we bolster OPE's cybersecurity, mitigate exploits, and protect user data while fostering long-term security for the educational platform.

3. ** Environment Specific Tests
- We're enhancing our testing approach by crafting environment-specific testing scripts
- Tailoring the solution makes our tests more robust, addressing critical aspects like ASLR, user ID generation, and unique user limits within the NERF environment.
- These scripts ensure comprehensive validation, adaptability to evolving conditions, and resilience in our educational platform, reinforcing our commitment to meeting project-specific requirements effectively.
 
 

## 5. Acceptance criteria

Minimum acceptance criteria: 
   - The tests ensure that the base container only passes the build process if all of the packages are compatible and fully functioning, the address randomization works (need to clarify more on      this), and all of the dynamic content functions as intended.
   - Successfully deploy base container to NERC or some test cluster.
   - Implement all of the ope commands listed in the OPE-Testing *tools* branch as described by Professor Appavoo to allow for a more user-friendly framework for content creation. Also, add          necessary documentation for these commands.

Stretch goals: 
   - Add tool for translating textbooks written in LaTeX into the Jupyter Notebook format so that they can be hosted online and provide additional functionality by incorporating the suite of         Jupyter tools.

## 6.  Release Planning:

Release planning section describes how the project will deliver incremental sets of features and functions in a series of releases to completion. Identification of user stories associated with iterations that will ease/guide sprint planning sessions is encouraged. Higher level details for the first iteration is expected.

1. **Build OPE Base Image and Container Locally and Verify Testing Procedures (8 tests)**
   - Construct the OPE base image both locally. Ensure the image is functional and can run seamlessly.
   - Familiarize with the Makefile and Dockerfile and Gain a comprehensive understanding of their structures and functionalities to aid in future modifications.
   - Refactor the Makefile and Dockerfile to ensure system independence and compatibility across various Instruction Set Architectures, specifically arm64 and x86.
   - Navigate to the workflow file located at OPE-Testing/.github/workflows/Master_Container_Test.yaml. Run the predefined tests and assess their performance, ensuring all tests function as expected.
2. **Expand upon testing for RISE, write testing for Address randomization.**
   - Write address randomization tests using gdb.
   - Add onto selenium tests with RISE, look for missed edge cases.
3. **Write multimedia and terminal verification tests**
   - Write tests (maybe in Selenium?) for multimedia players and dynamic content. Also, write some tests to ensure the terminal functions as             required.
4. **Add functionality for ope commands listed by appavoo in tools branch**
   - Meet with Professor Appavoo (or send an email, but ideally meet) to ask for clarification where needed on the commands and verify our understanding is correct for each.
5. **Write code to translate LaTeX projects into OPE Jupyter NB framework**
   - At least start the framework for this. A professor who already wrote their textbook in LaTeX wants an easy migration to this platform to reap all the benefits of the OPE features and            hosting it online, but the barrier to entry is all the work of rewriting.
   - Write this code with pandoc and bash, maybe python too to parse sections of LaTeX and use *ope tools* developed in sprint 4 to make this process easier.

## General comments

Remember that you can always add features at the end of the semester, but you can't go back in time and gain back time you spent on features that you couldn't complete.
