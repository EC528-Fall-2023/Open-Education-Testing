## Project Description Template

The purpose of this Project Description is to present the ideas proposed and decisions made during the preliminary envisioning and inception phase of the project. The goal is to analyze an initial concept proposal at a strategic level of detail and attain/compose an agreement between the project team members and the project customer (mentors and instructors) on the desired solution and overall project direction.

This template proposal contains a number of sections, which you can edit/modify/add/delete/organize as you like.  Some key sections weâ€™d like to have in the proposal are:

- Vision: An executive summary of the vision, goals, users, and general scope of the intended project.

- Solution Concept: the approach the project team will take to meet the business needs. This section also provides an overview of the architectural and technical designs made for implementing the project.

- Scope: the boundary of the solution defined by itemizing the intended features and functions in detail, determining what is out of scope, a release strategy and possibly the criteria by which the solution will be accepted by users and operations.

Project Proposal can be used during the follow-up analysis and design meetings to give context to efforts of more detailed technical specifications and plans. It provides a clear direction for the project team; outlines project goals, priorities, and constraints; and sets expectations.

## 1.   Vision and Goals Of The Project:

The vision section describes the final desired state of the project once the project is complete. It also specifies the key goals of the project. This section provides a context for decision-making. A shared vision among all team members can help ensuring that the solution meets the intended goals. A solid vision clarifies perspective and facilitates decision-making.
The vision statement should be specific enough that you can look at a proposed solution and say either "yes, this meets the vision and goals", or "no, it does not".



Our project's vision is to create an innovative and immersive educational environment where the integration of Jupyter notebooks and Linux terminal interactions transcends traditional learning boundaries. We aim to cultivate a dynamic ecosystem where teachers and students can utilize technology to enhance the educational experience. Some of our visions and improvements consist of: 

Integration of Comprehensive Tests: We recognize the importance of the Master_Container_Test.yml, which consolidates various image, build, gdb, and UI tests into one. To improve this, we will continually update and expand the test suite to cover a broader range of scenarios and edge cases. This will ensure comprehensive validation of the OPE repository base container image.

Recognizing  limitations of outdated testing methods: We are committed to a modernization effort centered around automation. By embracing automated testing, continuous integration and deployment, and scalable frameworks, we aim to improve reliability, efficiency, and adaptability in our testing approach. This shift ensures that as the Open Education (OPE) project evolves, testing practices evolve with it, delivering a more robust and future-ready educational platform.

Continuous Monitoring: We will implement continuous monitoring of our container images to identify any discrepancies, vulnerabilities, or performance issues. This proactive approach will help us maintain the reliability and security of the OPE environment.

Custom Test Development: As part of our commitment to improving the OPE project, we will develop new custom tests tailored to the specific requirements and unique features of our containerized educational materials. These tests will be designed to address our project's needs. 

Training and Skill Development: We recognize the importance of equipping our team members with the skills and knowledge required to excel in testing and automation. We will invest in training, building, and skill development to enhance our team's capabilities.




## 2. Users/Personas Of The Project:

Open Education is designed to provide greater accessibility for computer science educators and students. Users will have an easy method of distributing their content from a virtual environment through open source material. This is included but may not be limited to online textbooks, lectures, machine learning tools, as well as interactive kernel environments. Hosts of large computer science events (ie. hackathons) will also be able to use this online platform to provide a consistent environment among each user, with the same packages for everyone. Users of this platform may include but are not limited to:
* Educators within any field of computer science or engineering
* Authors looking to publish free open-source textbooks online
* Students involved in large computer science activites or events

## 3.   Scope and Features Of The Project:

The Scope places a boundary around the solution by detailing the range of features and functions of the project. This section helps to clarify the solution scope and can explicitly state what will not be delivered as well.

It should be specific enough that you can determine that e.g. feature A is in-scope, while feature B is out-of-scope.

## 4. Solution Concept

This section provides a high-level outline of the solution.

Global Architectural Structure Of the Project:

This section provides a high-level architecture or a conceptual diagram showing the scope of the solution. If wireframes or visuals have already been done, this section could also be used to show how the intended solution will look. This section also provides a walkthrough explanation of the architectural structure.

 

Design Implications and Discussion:

This section discusses the implications and reasons of the design decisions made during the global architecture design.

## 5. Acceptance criteria

This section discusses the minimum acceptance criteria at the end of the project and stretch goals.

## 6.  Release Planning:

Release planning section describes how the project will deliver incremental sets of features and functions in a series of releases to completion. Identification of user stories associated with iterations that will ease/guide sprint planning sessions is encouraged. Higher level details for the first iteration is expected.

## General comments

Remember that you can always add features at the end of the semester, but you can't go back in time and gain back time you spent on features that you couldn't complete.
